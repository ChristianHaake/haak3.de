Even though Anytype is still in its beta phase, the software operates extremely smoothly and reliably. I have encountered no issues while using it and find the application to be very user-friendly and efficient. For anyone interested in an innovative tool for knowledge management and information organization, Anytype is definitely worth exploring. The software can be downloaded from the Anytype.io website.
