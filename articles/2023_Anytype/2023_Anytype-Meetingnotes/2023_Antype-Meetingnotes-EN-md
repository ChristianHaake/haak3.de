# Meeting Notes Management with Anytype

## Meeting Notes Set

Anytype is characterized by its high flexibility, allowing users to structure the tool according to their specific needs. This led to the creation of a new object called "Meeting Note", under which each new meeting note is recorded. To ensure consistency, the same template is always used for meeting notes. This simplifies the process and ensures uniform additional information for each entry. 

The meeting notes are collected in a set called "Meeting Notes". This set acts as a database where all meeting notes are organized. The Table-View is preferred, as it provides a clear overview of all entries and contains fixed columns for relations or additional information required for specific workflows. Some key features and benefits of the Anytype Meeting Notes system are:

- **Structuring by date**: The meeting notes are organized in chronological order, with the newest at the top. This facilitates quick access to current notes.
- **Differentiation by type**: Meeting notes can be divided into different types, such as "Workshop / Keynote" and "Meeting". This aids in the quick identification of the meeting content and promotes systematic organization. The relationship type is consistently used in all contexts where a type can be selected, ensuring consistency in the system.
- **Relationship to CRM**: Each meeting note has a direct connection to the CRM, indicating who attended the meeting or with whom discussions were held. This is particularly useful in combination with the CRM set, which contains contacts of all people with whom communication exists. Thus, users can view all meetings and conversations they have participated in on a person's contact page and inform themselves about the discussed topics.
- **Tag relation**: Theme tags are consistently used across all areas of the system. Meeting notes are tagged to categorize them thematically, creating a network of thematic links over the months.
- **Project relationship**: Each meeting note can be linked to specific projects. This is not only beneficial for project management and tracking but also allows the display of these meeting notes on the respective project pages.

## Template for Meeting Notes

The effective management of meeting notes requires a clear and simple structure that allows all necessary information to be captured quickly and efficiently. In designing my template for meeting notes, I focused on the essential components necessary for documenting and tracking meeting outcomes. The core of the template is its simplicity. The main purpose is to highlight the content and allow users to focus on the essentials. Therefore, there are some indispensable input fields, such as the date of the meeting, the type, and the person involved. These fields provide a quick overview of the context of the meeting and assist in the categorization and archiving of notes.

Even though Anytype is still in its beta phase, the software operates extremely smoothly and reliably. I have encountered no issues while using it and find the application to be very user-friendly and efficient. For anyone interested in an innovative tool for knowledge management and information organization, Anytype is definitely worth exploring. The software can be downloaded from the Anytype.io website.
